  <h3>Office Workstation Network Setup</h3>
</center>

<p class="bold"><a name="overview"></a>Overview</p>
<p>The following describes setting up a local Microsoft client network using workgroups (as opposed to a domain). For the purposes of this discussion the term &quot;network&quot; will refer to this local client network.</p>
<p>Since there will be no DHCP server you must assign each computer a fixed IP address. IP addresses are composed of four &quot;octets&quot; like 192.168.254.100. Each octet can be from 0 to 255. For this network the first three octets will remain constant and the last one will change for each computer on the network.</p>
<p>The FasTrak2&trade; and Sure-Trak2&trade; boards are set to use addresses with the first three octets set to 192.168.254. The computer network should use a different set of octets. For this documentation <b>10.172.16</b> will be used for the first three octets for the addresses of computers on the network.</p>
<p>Each computer will need to have a unique address with the first three octets, 10.172.16, the same and the last octet different for each one.</p>
<p>You should decide on and record the IP addresses of each computer before you begin.</p>
<p>For example,</p>

<table cellspacing="0";>
  <tr><th>Computer</th><th>IP Address</th></tr>
  <tr><td>Monitoring Computer #1</td><td>10.172.16.100</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Monitoring Computer #2</td><td> 10.172.16.101</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Office Workstation</td><td> 10.172.16.102</td></tr>
  </table>

<p class="bold"><a name="names"></a>Naming the Computers</p>
<p>In addition to the IP address each computer on the network must have a unique name. The name is normally 15 characters or less and can NOT have any spaces. You-can-use-hyphens instead of spaces. </p>
<p>Older versions of the True-Trak 2020&trade; software restricted the network names of the True-Trak computers to three characters or less with the following naming conventions.</p>
<table cellspacing="0";>
<tr>
<td>WS0</td>
<td>(W S zero) The Office Workstation.</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>W01</td><td>Monitoring computers are named with a leading 'W' followed by the number of the machine they are monitoring [1,99]; For machine 1 this would be W01 (W zero one). For machine 99 it would be W99.</td>
</tr></table>
<p>This three character limit is no longer true and you can now name the computers whatever you wish.</p>
<a name="monitor"><p class="bold">Setting Up the Network on the Monitoring Computer</p></a>
<p>It is assumed that the Monitoring Computer has been used as a stand alone computer and is not currently connected to the network.</p>
<p>The monitoring computer has two ethernet ports labeled "FasTrak2 Direct Connection" and "Local Area Connection".</p>
<p>On a standalone system the "FasTrak2 Direct Connection" is connected directly to the FasTrak2™ board.</p>
<p>On a DCT, which is a single monitoring computer connected to more than one FasTrak2 board, the &quot;FasTrak2 Direct Connection&quot; is connected to the same ethernet switch as the &quot;Local Area Connection&quot;.</p>
<p>In either case the "Local Area Connection" is available to connect to the network. The RJ45 ethernet connecter for the cable from the network is located on the top of the Monitoring Computer's cabinet.</p>

<table class="pic"> <tr>
<td class="pic">Show the Network Connections by pressing the &quot;Start&quot; button, choosing &quot;Settings&quot;, and then &quot;Network Connections&quot; as shown here.</td>
<td class="pic"><img src="./images/net1.gif"></td>

<p>The Network Connections folder will show the two ports, the FasTrak2 Direct Connection and the Local Area Connection. Double click the icon to the left of the "FasTrak2 Direct Connection"</p>

<p class="bold"><a name="da"></a>Setting Up the Network on the Office Workstation</p>
<p>The setup for the is similar to that of the Monitoring Computer except that there is no "FasTrak2 Direct Connection" port as this computer does not connect to a FasTrak2™ or Sure-Trak2™ board.</p>

<table class="pic"> <tr>
<td class="pic">Bring up the Network Connections screen.</td>

<p>You will see a list of the ports on this computer. The list may or may not look exactly like this. If you need to determine which port the network is plugged into just plug and unplug the ethernet cable from the RJ45 connector on the computer and watch the status (circled below in red) change from "Connected" to &quot;Network cable unplugged&quot;.</p>
<img src="./images/net10.gif"><br>
<p>Set up the IP address on this computer the same way as the Local Area Connection on the Monitoring Computer but using the IP address you decided on for this computer. In the example above this was 10.172.16.102 for the Office Workstation.</p>
<p>Check the IP address of any other network connections on this computer. There may not be any other network connections but if there are you need to make sure they are not set to use an address with the same first three octets, 10.172.16.</p>
