<h2 class="center">Overview</h2>
<dl>
<dt>Monitoring Computer</dt>
<dd>A True-Trak 2020&trade; &quot;Monitoring Computer&quot; is a stand-alone computer that connects to either a FasTrak2&trade; monitor board or Sure-Trak2&trade; control board to display and record shots. </dd>
<dt>Office Workstation</dt>
<dd>An &quot;Office Workstation&quot; is a separate computer that connects to the Monitoring Computers. The Office Workstation displays the shots from all of the Monitoring Computers as they are made, allowing you to monitor the current state of all of your die cast machines from one central location.</dd>
<dt>Network</dt>
<dd>The computers are connected with an ethernet network. The programs use peer-to-peer file sharing where
each Monitoring Computer keeps it's own shot data on it's local drive and shares this with the Office Workstation.</dd>
