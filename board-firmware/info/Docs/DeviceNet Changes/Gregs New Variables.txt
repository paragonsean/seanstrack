V453:  Set to zero if virtual fieldbus I/O is not being used.  Set to 1 (probably more to come later) if using DeviceNet.

V454:  This is the divisor for setting the baud rate for the board's UART2 port.  It is calculated using this formula:
V454 = (33.3333MHz / desired baud rate)-1 == (V300 / desired baud rate) -1 Since V300 = the board's clock frequency.
For example, if the user wanted to use 38.4KB, V454 = (33,333,333 / 38,400) - 1 = 867.
This is ignored if V453 is set to zero.

V455 is used for test purposes.   You can set this to zero.
