Jay,

Here's updated firmware.  I've also included a new control_all file as well.

There are 3 new variables that set up the deviceNet I/O:

V453:  Set to zero if virtual fieldbus I/O is not being used.  Set to 1 (probably more to come later) if using DeviceNet.

V454:  This is the divisor for setting the baud rate for the board's UART2 port.  It is calculated using this formula:
V454 = (33.3333MHz / desired baud rate)-1 == (V300 / desired baud rate) -1 Since V300 = the board's clock frequency.
For example, if the user wanted to use 38.4KB, V454 = (33,333,333 / 38,400) - 1 = 867.
This is ignored if V453 is set to zero.

V455 is used for test purposes.   You can set this to zero.

Perhaps we can use an "ini" file for now to set these? Otherwise, in the short term, I can just change the control_all file to set these if necessary.

I spoke too soon earlier, Joe emailed me today asking when I can come back.  When do you think we may be ready to begin testing the changes?

Thanks Jay,

Greg
