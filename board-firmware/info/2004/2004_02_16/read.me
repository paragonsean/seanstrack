The watchdog timer is reset from within the control loop.  
That should stop the board from resetting continuously like you were seeing.

I also added the ability to manually stop the control program by pressing SW8.  
Since the control loop is an interrupt service routine, if it never exits
polled code like Ethernet will never get a chance to execute.
