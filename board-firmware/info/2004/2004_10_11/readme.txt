This file changes the board so it will not process messages until it is done with the shot.
This should fix the problem of my stopping the control during the shot.

This will be included in V6.16 but should be retrofitable to anything that uses flash 4_11.

Greg sent this file on the 11th. On the 12th he replaced it with a new file
of the same name. I deleted the file from the 11th and replaced it with this one.

We need to delete the .G and .H lines from the upload file.
