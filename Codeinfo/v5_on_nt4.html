<center><h3>Windows NT Problems</h3></center>
<p>
The main problem with Windows NT is that you must set up a user account for each computer
that is going to access a shared directory.
<p>
For example, a monitoring computer communicates with both WS0 and FS. If the monitoring
computer is an NT system then you must set up a user account for each of these.
<p>
The user account is set up using the <b>Login Name</b> and <b>Password</b> of the other computers.
Let me use the Data Server as an example.
<p>
Normally we set the Primary Network Logon of the Data Server
(in the network properties) to
<b>Windows Logon</b> so that the computer does not ask for a logon when
it boots up. You can find out what the current logon is by choosing to log in as another user.
On most Microsoft systems (except for 98) you do this by choosing <b>Shutdown</b> from the <b>Start</b>
menu and then choose <b>Close all programs and log on as a different user</b>.
<p>
In order for windows to log you in automatically you must have the password set to nothing.
<p>
If you log in as <b>FS</b> with no password then in order for you to access the
files on the NT monitoring computer you must create a new user on the monitoring computer
(<b>Start</b>, <b>Programs</b>, <b>Administrative Tools (Common)</b>, <b>User Manager</b>).
The new user must have a username of <b>FS</b> and no password. I usually make the user a power user and make
sure to set the <b>Password Never Expires</b> checkbox.
