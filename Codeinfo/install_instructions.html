<body>
You can download the current english version of the software here
<p>
http://www.visi-trakworldwide.com/get.htm
<p>
The program you will download will be <b>v639.exe</b>. Copy this to your hard drive and run it. It will create a C:\Install6.39 directory
and copy the installation files there.
<p>
Now go to the following page
<p>
http://www.visi-trakworldwide.com/getnet.htm
<p>
and download <b>ns.exe</b>. Copy this file to your hard drive and run it. I will create a C:\Install.ns directory and copy the installation
files for the NetSetup program there.
<p>
I am assuming you are installing a new system. On each DCT do the following.

<ul>
<li>Run C:\Install6.39\Setup.exe</li>
<li>Press the <b>Install New TrueTrak System</b> button.</li>
<li>Check the box next to <b>Start Board Monitor at TrueTrak Startup</b>.</li>
<li>Check the box next to <b>Automatically Start when the Computer Boots</b>.</li>

</ul>

<li>Check the box next to <b>This is an Office Workstation or Data Archiver</b>.</li>
<li>Press the <b>Continue</b> button to begin the installation</li>
<li>When this is done, close the installation program and run C:\Install.ns\Setup.exe. Press the <b>Begin</b> button to install
the NetSetup program. When it is done, press the <b>Esc</b> key to close the install program.</li>
</ul>
