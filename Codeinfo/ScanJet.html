<h3>ScanJet IIcx Installation for Win98</h3>
The CD with version 2.9 of the installation software is in the
ScanJet folder in the computer cabinet.
<p>
First you have to install the scsi card. It is not plug and play
so you have to Add New Hardware and choose scsi controller.
<p>
Brouse to D:\Disk1 and choose the hpscan.inf file, then the
Symbios Logic 53C400A (HP Version) SCSI Adapter.
<p>
This is set up with:
<ul>
<li>Input/Output 0280-028F</li>
<li>IRQ 5</li>
</ul>
<p>
If this is a clean install, the os will find the scanner and install it.
I then installed the scanner software by running
Setup.exe in the Disk1 folder.
<p>
This didn't work so I had to delete the scanner (not the scsi card) from the
hardware list and reboot.
<p>
When you reboot from this the operating system will find the
scanner again and, again, will find the
drivers. You will be prompted for the location of the Win98 CD
and will have to point it to the C:\win98 folder.
