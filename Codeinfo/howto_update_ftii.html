<title>How to Update a FasTrak2 Board to a New Firmware Version</title>
</head>
<body>
<ol>
<li>Pull down the "Help" menu of the Plot program and choose "FasTrak2 Help".</li>
<li>Under "Misc", click on "External Interface Boards".</li>
<li>Look at your external interface board and compare it to the photos to determine which you have (Rev B or Rev E).</li>
<li>If you don't have a Rev E board give me a call.
<li>Shut down all True-Trak software.</li>
<li>Rename the current C:\Ftii directory to C:\Ftii_Old</li>
<li>Copy the ftii_files.exe program to the root directory and run it from there. It will create a C:\Ftii directory and copy
the new ftii files there.</li>
<li>Unplug any network cables to the monitoring computer. You should only have one cable from the cpu board
to the blue ethernet switch and another from the blue ethernet switch to the FasTrak2 board.</li>
<li>Run the "terminal.exe" program in the C:\Ftii directory.</li>
<li>The title of this program is "FasTrak2 Terminal" followed by the ip address of the FasTrak2 board. If this is not the address of
the board that you wish to update then pull down the "Edit" menu and choose "Address". Enter the ip address of the board in the
editbox to the right of "Tcp/Ip Address". The "Port" should be "20000". Press the "Save Changes" button for this to take effect.</li>
<li>At the bottom of the screen is an editbox. Enter "OV" ( letter o letter v) and press Enter. This will ask the board to identify
the version of firmware that is currently loaded.
<br>
You should get a response from the board similar to the following.
<pre>R:5#cyc_chip_14010201
R:6#cyc_7_04, monitor_and_control, interrupt driven control, polled Ethernet, UDP, handshake, ad_loop19</pre>
If the response begins with "R:6#cyc" then this is a newer version of the FasTrak2 board called a "Cyclone" board. If the
response begins with "R:6:emc" then this is the older FasTrak2 board.
<br>The number after the above strings is the current firmware version. In the example above the firmware version is 7_04. On
yours it will say 4_14c. I am pretty sure you have one of the older FasTrak2 boards and not the Cyclone board.
</li>
<li>Pull down the "File" menu and choose "Upload File".</li>
<li>Press the "Flash 6" radio button if this is the older FasTrak2 board or "Flash 7" if this is a Cyclone board.</li>
<li>Make sure the "All Files" box is checked.</li>
<li>Press "Begin" to upload all the files.</li>
<li>When the uploads are complete, enter "NM" in the editbox at the bottom of the screen and press Enter. The board should
respond with the current ethernet settings.

<li>Even though these appear correct, reenter the tcp/ip address of the board.

<br>and press Enter.
<br>Be sure to enter a space after the "N2".
