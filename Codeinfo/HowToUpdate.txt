Creating the Installation Directory

1. Copy the v637.exe program to your C drive.
2. Run the resulting c:\v637.exe file. This will create a c:\install6.37 directory on your computer.
   This directory contains all the files you need to install a new system  or to update the an existing system.

Updating an existing installation

1. Run c:\install6.37\setup.exe.
2. Press the "Update Existing TrueTrak System" button.
3. On the next screen just press the "Continue" button.
4. On the next screen you are presented with a number of options. These should already be filled in
   with the current settings. If the "Copy Ft2 Control Files" checkbox is checked you should leave it
   this way as these files are needed to talk to the FasTrak2 or SureTrak2 board.
5. Press the "Continue" button to begin the update.
