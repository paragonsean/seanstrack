<h3>Password Levels Overview</h3>
You change the password level by pulling down the <b>File</b> menu and
choosing <b>Passwords</b>.
<p>
<img src="EnterPW.gif" align=right>
You are then presented with a dialog box that allows you to enter a new password.
Each password has a <b>level</b> and <b>owner</b> associated with it. For example, the <b>Default</b>
password is shipped at level 10. the <b>Engineer</b> password
is shipped at level 5.
<p>
The owner is just a human name. It is only used if you have defined a password change log file.
<p>
For password levels, big is good. Each menu item on the
main menu has a password level. If you do not have a level at least
this big you don't even get to see the menu item.
<p>
For example, the <b>Text Editor</b> menu item is shipped at level 10.
If you are at the <b>Engineer</b> level, level 5, you won't see the <b>Text&nbsp;Editor</b>
menu item when you pull down the <b>File</b> menu.
<p>
This isn't a very sophisticated system, however. To change the password levels of
the menu items you merely change the entry in the associated menu file.
<p>
The main menu file is <b>C:\V5\EXES\PROFILE.MNU</b>.
This is just a text file which you can edit with the Visi-Trak Text Editor.
<p>
Each line in the file is a menu item or separator. At the end of each line is
the password level of the line. The first few lines are shown below.

<pre>
0,&File,-1,0
1,Choose &Shots...,109,0
1,&Choose Part...,113,0
2,SEPARATOR,-1,0
1,&Backup and Restore,706,5
</pre>
if you change the Backup and Restore line from
<pre>1,&Backup and Restore,706,5</pre>
to
<pre>1,&Backup and Restore,706,10</pre>
then the password level for this item will be raised from 5 to 10. The changes will not
take affect until you restart the program or change your current password level.
<p>
You can edit the passwords and the levels associated with them if you have a password
level of 9 or above or if you level is the highest one in the password list.
<p>
The <b>Default</b> password is special. This is the level that the program
uses when it is first run.

<h3>Fixed Password Levels</h3>
There are some "built-in" levels that were put in before the author realized
that nothing should be built in. These are
