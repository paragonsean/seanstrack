<h2>Installing the TrueTrak 2020 Monitoring Software for the FasTrak2</h2>

<h3>Copying the software from the CD to the Data Collection Terminal (DCT)</h3>
<ol>
<li>Run the <b>V604.exe</b> program. This will create a <b>C:\Install6.04</b>
folder on your computer.
</li>
<li>Run the <b>FT2_Install.exe</b> program. This will create a <b>C:\Ft2_Setup</b> folder on your computer.</li>
<li>Open the <b>C:\Install6.04</b> folder and run the <b>Setup.exe</b> program. This will install the
TrueTrak 2020 ™ monitoring software on your system.</li>
<li>  On the opening screen, choose <b>Install New TrueTrak System</b></li>
<li>  On the next screen click the checkboxes next to
    <ul>
    <li>Start Part Editor at TrueTrak Startup</li>
    <li>Start Board Monitor at TrueTrak Startup</li>
    <li>FasTrak2</li>
    </ul>
</li>
<li>Press the <b>Continue</b> Button to complete the installation.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Setting up the TCP/IP Addresses</h3>
<ol>
<li>Determine the TCP/IP addresses that you are going to use for the computer and the Board. If you are going to have
more than one FasTrak2 board on the same network you will need a separate fixed address for each board. The
default address for the board is <b>192.168.254.30</b> with a subnet mask of <b>255.255.255.0</b>.</li>

<li>If you are using one of our computers, the computer will probably be set up with an address of <b>192.168.254.40</b>.</li>

<li>If you need to change the address of the FasTrak2 board you will need to connect a serial cable from the COM1 port of the
computer to the serial port of the FasTrak2 board.</li>
<li>You will then need to put the FasTrak2 board into Germs mode by holding down the <b>SW7</b> button,
pressing and releasing the <b>SW9</b> button, and then releasing the <b>SW7</b>. If you have done this
correctly you will see that the led displays will show <b>88</b>.
<li>You will then need to
open an MS-Dos window. This is called a <b>Command Prompt</b>
on newer versions of Windows.
<br>Once in the MS_Dos window, enter <b>CD \Ft2_Setup</b> to move to that folder and then enter
<b>T</b> to upload the program that allows you to change the TCP/IP address of the board.
</li>
<li>Once the program has been uploaded you will be shown the current network address. At the prompt, press the <b>A</b> key
to go to the <b>Network Settings</b> menu and then the <b>C</b> key to change the settings.</li>
<li>The first address that is displayed is the hardware address of the board. This does not need to be changed unless
you have more than one FasTrak2 board on the same network. In that case you should change the last number of the
hardware address so that each FasTrak2 board has a different one.</li>
<li>The next address is the TCP/IP address. Change this as necessary.</li>
<li>Skip the <b>nameserver ip address</b> by pressing <b>Enter</b>.</li>
<li>The subnet mask is displayed next. Change this if you need to.</li>
<li>Skip the <b>gateway ip address</b>.</li>
<li>Press <b>B</b> to save the changes and then, when this is completed, press <b>Q</b> to return to the
main menu and then <b>C</b> to exit the program.</li>
<li>Press the <b>SW9</b> button on the FasTrak2 board to reset the board.</li>
</ol>
