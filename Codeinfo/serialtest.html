<h3>True-Trak 2020 (tm) Serialtest Program</h3>

The serialtest.exe program allows you to test the connection to your stamp machine without having to run a die cast machine.
<p>
When you run the program you will see the various serial setups. These setups are described in the <b>v5serial.html</b> file. When you press the "Save This Setup" button the setups are stored in the <b>serialtest.ini</b> file that is located in the same directory as the program.
<p>
When you have the interface to the stamp machine working, you will need to copy those entries in the serialtest.ini file that begin with "EOS" to the <b>C:\V5\Exes\Monall.ini</b> file. You do this by pressing the "Save to True-Trak Setup" button.

You will have to restart the True-Trak 2020 (tm) monitoring software before the changes will take place.
