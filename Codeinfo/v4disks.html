You will need four blank, formatted, diskettes. Label them
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Disk 1</li>
  <li>Disk 2</li>
  <li>Disk 3</li>
  <li>Update 4.32</li>
  </ul>
<p>
I am assuming that you are in the office, working on a Windows 95, 98, NT, etc., computer
and that the four files, Disk1.exe, Disk2.exe, Disk3.exe, and Update4.exe, have been
downloaded onto the hard drive of that computer.
</p>
<p>
Put the first diskette, <b>Disk 1</b>, into the diskette drive and run the <b>Disk1.exe</b> program.
This will copy the necessary files to Disk 1.
</p>
<p>
Repeat this with
<table border>
  <tr><th>Diskette Name</th><th>Program to Run</th></tr>
  <tr><td>Disk 2</td><td>Disk2.exe</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Disk 3</td><td>Disk3.exe</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Update 4.32</td><td>Update4.exe</td></tr>
  </table>

<p>
Now that you have created the installation and update diskettes,
I assume you are doing the rest of the installation on the MS-DOS based monitoring computer.
</p>

<h3>Full Installation</h3>

<p>
Diskettes 1 through 3 are used to do a full installation of the program.
This will delete all existing data on the computer.
If you are going to do this you should first remove all <nobr>Visi-Trak</nobr> directories
(you can back up your current system with backupv4.exe first if you wish).
Delete the following directories if they exist.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>V4</li>
  <li>V4LOCAL</li>
  <li>PDOXRUN</li>
  <li>PRIVATE</li>
  </ul>
<p>
For example, to delete the V4 directory enter the following two lines.
<code>
<br>
CD \
<br>
DELTREE V4
</code>
</P>
<p>
Now, insert <b>Disk 3</b> into the diskette drive and enter the following two lines.
<code>
<br>
A:
<br>
INSTALL  A  C
</code>
</p>
<p>
You will be prompted to insert each of the three diskettes.
This will install a Version 4.29 of the software. When the installation is done,
continue with the update to Version 4.32 as described below.
</p>
<h3>Update an Existing installation</h3>
<p>
Insert the <b>Update 4.32</b> diskette into the diskette drive and enter the following two lines.
<code>
<br>
A:
<br>
UPDATE  A  C
</code>
</p>
<p>
This will update your system to the current version. You can start the program by entering
</p>
<code>V4</code>
