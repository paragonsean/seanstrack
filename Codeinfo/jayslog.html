<h3>Friday 27-Sep-02</h3>
<p>
Ray Kultzen called from Thomas to remind me that I promised to make the courner parameters
and trend chart setups part based. He said they are about ready to sign a po that would have
Al there at the end of Oct and he would like the changes done by then.

I said they would be done.

<h3>Wednesday 02-Oct-02</h3>

Mark asked to let people change the velocity
column in the suretrak control but nothing else. I did this by changing the <b>Save Changes</b>
button to <b>Vel. Changes</b> if the password level is not high enough to save changes but is
&gt;= VelocityChangesLevel in editpart.ini. Because anything in the editor might have been changed, I
reload the suretrak setup and then change only the velocity changes.

I don't know how many people are going to want this. I suppose I need to put a note somewhere that will
catch people's attention that it is possible but for now it's just for Mark.
<p>

I promised Ray Kultgen at Thomas that I would make the corner parameters and the trend chart parameters
part based. The setups are contained in the following files, all in the exes folder now.
<ul>
<li>tcconfig.ini</li>
<li>display.ini</li>
<li>fixedparam.ini</li>
<li>tcparams.dat</li>
</ul>

<h3>Wednesday 15-Oct-02</h3>
I finished the help file additions for the new options screen, made up a
tentative V5.72 and gave it to Al to try out.

<h3>Monday 28-Oct-02</h3>
Ray Kultgen from Thomas called to see if I had finished the requests he had. He said they had bought
the software update agreement. I told him the popup screen and the part based corner parameters and trend
chart parameters were done. He was going to talk to JB about having Al come up to install them.


<h3>Tuesday 29-Oct-02</h3>

Sean called from Orlick. They have one machine that only prints half a graph. The other three print ok. They have HPM units with NT4. I could find no way to change the handshakeing, which I assume was the cause of the problem. I finally told Sean I knew of no way to fix it.

<h3>Wednesday 30-Oct-02</h3>

Got a call from James Harrison,(905 544 1997 ext 250) Orlick's computer guy, to fix the printer problem. He tried changing the bios settings for the printer port but to no avail. He then swapped the hard drive from one of the other machines and still had the problem - implying that it is a cpu or cable problem.
<p>
I later learned from Ying that they had this problem last week and swapped the cpu to another box and the problem went with the cpu.
<p>
I told Harrison that I would call him tomorrow.
<p>
I added a check in the part editor so when you try to delete a part I won't let you if it is the warmup part for another part.

<h3>Thursday 31-Oct-02</h3>

I changed the way I copy parts so if I copy to another machine and part has a warmup part that doesn't exist on that machine I will copy the warmup part as well.
<p>

When the suretrak program starts it checks the runlist to make sure that all the parts exist.

<h3>Thursday 7-Nov-02</h3>
Finished work on the website for a while. I still need some copy for the home page but it works ok.
<p>
We got a po today to add the ability to reflect an input to the fastrak board to one of the alarm bits. This will be done at the end of each shot just like an alarm.

<h3>Monday 11-Nov-02</h3>
Put the suretrak pdf file on the psuedo-site today. Fixed the javascript so it loads the graphics in order on the home page.

<h3>Wednesday 13-Nov-02</h3>
I finished the operator interface for the reflected alarms for amt. I put them in the advanced setup, mainly because there was room there.
Dundas wasn't giving up focus when I got a tab or shift-tab. I trapped these in the OnCharDown() function, which only gets characters when the cell is not in edit mode, and sent the focus to the proper control (see editpart.cpp).

<h3>Monday 18-Nov-02</h3>
Added an entry on the aboutus page for the japan show.

<h3>Wednesday 20-Nov-02</h3>
Added functions to WINDOW_CLASS to add and remove styles. Decided to create a part-based ini file, config.ini, to put future partbased settings in. An example of this is the part-based display and trend chart settings. I wish I had not created a new partdisplay.ini file for them but it's too late to change it now. In the future I will put all such in the config.ini file.
<p>
I considered writing a minimalist xml reader for this, and I still may add that to the INI_CLASS.
<p>
I added a set_section function to the INI_CLASS and a new find function that only has the key string. This makes searching and then loading a lot cleaner.

<h3>Thursday 21-Nov-02</h3>
I changed the string class to NOT delete the string if I set it to a null or empty string.
I just put a null at the start.

<h3>Friday 22-Nov-02</h3>
Made still another try at getting the address for Japan correct. We'll see...
<p>
Finished the editor for the multipart runlist for HPM. Still need to do the help screen.

<h3>Monday 02-Dec-02</h3>
I changed the uggrid.cpp program to use the COLOR_BTNFACE color for the background of unused grid space such as right and bottom. It had previously used the default background color which was lighter than the dialog box background and looked funny.

<h3>Tuesday 03-Dec-02</h3>

Sue couldn't run Crystal Reports. This is the first time she tried since I installed the new pervasive. The problem was missing dll's from the windows\system directory. The error message said that p2bbtrv.dll could not be found or run but the ones that were missing were s2dtconv.dll and sbtrvd32.dll. I copied these from my scuzzy machine and it appears to run.
<p>
We had this same problem with Tom's. I had forgotten but the solution then was to compare his old windows/system folder with the new one (we had switched drives and I still had the old drive).
<p>
I got the reflected inputs working and added some help to the help file, though I think some of that will change if we use the small opto board.

<h3>Thursday 05-Dec-02</h3>

I added a "Saving..." popup to the editpart program

<h3>Friday 06-Dec-02</h3>
Spent the afternoon making up a system to send to Sergey to use to install NT4 Japan on
a 586 system.

<h3>Monday 09-Dec-02</h3>

Sergey's disk would not boot. I found that the active partition had moved from 1 to 2.
<p>
Sergey did not install any video drivers. I installed them, the drivers were in the Video directory, and changed the 586 board to 800x600 by removing the jumper on JP3.

<h3>Thursday 12-Dec-02</h3>
Sean called to say that on both new units at Autocast they run ok for a while and then the grid and profiles dissappear, though the axis labels still appear.

of getting the timer frequency from the board when I connect and saving it at the beginning of the
shot data file. As I seed it this is the only place I need it and though this will take 4 bytes
per shot it will simplify the database and future upgrade code as I won't have to worry about
the frequency.
<p>There is also an issue about the first point. It has no data and merely represents
the start of the shot (actually the end of the first point is the start of shot) so I need some way of getting
the timer count for the start of shot so I can figure the velocity of the first quadrant of the
second point. I can approximate this by converting the 1 ms timer count to clock timer counts and subtracting
it from the <b>last</b> quadrant count of the second point
