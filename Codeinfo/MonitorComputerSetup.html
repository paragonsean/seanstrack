<h2>How To Set Up a Monitoring Computer on a Network</h2></center>
<p>
The monitoring computer is defined as the computer that is connected to the FasTrak or FasTrak2 board and
collects the data at the end of each shot.
The following assumes you are setting up a network of only the monitoring computers, office
workstations, and data archiver and that the monitoring computer is running Windows 98.
<p>

<h3>Computer Name and Workgroup Name</h3>
<ul>
<li><b>Right</b> click on the Network Neighborhood and select <b>Properties</b>.</li>
<li>Click on the <b>Identification</b> tab.</li>
<li>The <b>Computer name</b> should be set to a three character name such as <b>W01</b>, W02, etc. If you are running
True-Trak Version 6.11 or higher the three character limit does not apply.</li>
<li>The <b>Workgroup</b> should be set to <b>VISITRAK</b>.</li>
</ul>

<p>
<h3>Network Setup</h3>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Click on the <b>Configuration</b> tab.</li>
<li>You should see the following.
  <ul>
  <li>Client for Microsoft Networks</li>
  <li>A network adapter of some sort.
  <li>Either NetBEUI protocol or TCP/IP protocol.
    <ul>
    <li>If you have the NetBEUI protocol there is nothing to configure.</li>
    <li>if you have TCP/IP protocol you should.
      <ul>
      <li>Click once on the icon next to the TCP/IP. This will highlight that line.</li>
      <li>Click on the <b>Properties</b> button to bring up the <b>TCP/IP Properties</b> dialog.</li>
      <li>Set the <b>IP Address</b> to <b>192.168.254.101</b>. The last of these four numbers, <b>101</b>, must be different
      for each computer. We normally start with 101 and then use 102, 103, etc.</li>
      <li>Set the <b>Subnet Mask</b> to <b>255.255.255.0</b>.</li>
      <li>Press <b>OK</b> to close the dialog.</li>
      </ul></li>
    </ul></li>
  <li><b>File and printer sharing for Microsoft Networks</b>. If this is not present then...
  <ul>
  <li>Click on the <b>File and Print Sharing...</b> button.</li>
  <li>Check the <b>I want to give others access to my files</b> checkbox.</li>
  <li>Press the <b>OK</b> button to close the dialog.</li>
  </ul></li>
  </ul></li>

<li>Remove any other protocols and clients.</li>
<li>Press <b>OK.</b></li>
<li>After you reboot, log in with the same name as the computer name and <b>No</b> password.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Setting the Computer to Boot Directly Into Windows</h3>
<ul>
<li><b>Right</b> click on the Network Neighborhood and choose <b>Properties</b>.
<li>In the listbox under <b>Primary Network Login</b> choose <b>Windows Login</b></li>
<li>Press the <b>OK</b> button.</li>
<li>Windows will ask if you want to reboot. Click on the <b>No</b> button.</li>
</ul>
<p>

<h3>Sharing the V5 Directory</h3>
<ul>
<li>Run "My Computer"</li>
<li><b>Right</b> click the <b>C:\V5</b> folder.</li>
<li>Choose "Sharing..."</li>
<li>Click the <b>Shared As</b> button and the <b>Full</b> Button</li>
<li>Click "OK"</li>
</ul>

<h3>Connecting the Computers</h3>
<p>
The main office workstation, usually called WS0, should have the True-Trak Network Setup program installed. Run
this program. The following assumes you have Windows XP installed on the office workstation. If you don't have
Windows XP the process is the same but the details are a little different. The idea is to access the computers through the
Network Neighborhood and never as local drives.
<p>
If the monitoring computer you are installing already appears in the list of computers displayed by the program,
usually because you are installing a new hard drive, do the following.
<ul>
<li>Click once on the existing line for the monitoring computer you are installing. This will highlight the line.</li>
<li>Press the <b>Remove Computer(s)</b> button.</li>
<li>Press the <b>OK</b> button when assed if you wish to continue.</li>
</ul>

Add the new computer as follows.
<ul>
<li>Press the <b>Brouse For Computers</b> button.</li>
<li>Press the '+' next to <b>My Network Places</b>.</li>
<li>Press the '+' next to <b>Entire Network</b>.</li>
<li>Press the '+' next to <b>Microsoft Windows Network</b>.</li>
<li>Press the '+' next to <b>VISITRAK</b>.</li>
<li>Press the '+' next to the Monitoring Computer you are adding..</li>
<li>A <b>V5</b> folder will appear. Click once on this folder to add it to the list of computers.</li>
<li>Press the <b>OK</b> button to close the dialog.</li>
<li>Click once on the new line, the one that represents the new monitoring computer, that has been added to the listbox.</li>
<li>Make sure the <b>Type</b> is set to <b>Monitoring Computer</b>.</li>
<li>Make sure there is a <b>Yes</b> in the <b>Shared Full</b> column on the right side of the screen.</li>
<li>Highlight all the computers in the list by clicking once on the first entry and then holding down the <b>Shift</b> key
while clicking on the last entry.</li>
<li>Press the <b>Standard Connections</b> button to connect all of the computers. This will only affect
the new monitoring computer, the office workstation(s), and the data archiver.</li>
<li>Press <b>Save Changes</b> to save the changes to each computer.</li>
</ul>

Note that the changes will not take place until the True-Trak programs have been restarted on the computers that
have changed.
