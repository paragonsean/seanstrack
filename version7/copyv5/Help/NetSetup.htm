The Visi-Trak Worldwide Network Setup Program allows you to change the
way the computers are connected. Unlike most of the Visi-Trak ® programs
this one does not need to be run from a particular location. You can run
from a floppy disk if you wish. You should, however, run it from the
same place every time, as it saves the current list of computers and
connections in the same folder. The default location is <b>C:\VisiNet</b>.

<p>

When the program starts it displays it's current list of computers. If
it has no list it brings up a choose folder window.
<p>

<p>

To add a computer to the list from this window open
<b>My Network Places</b>, <b>Entire Network</b>, <b>Microsoft Windows Network</b> and then <b>Visitrak</b>,
in that order. Click on the "+" next to the computer you wish to add and then
click <b>once</b> on the
<b>\V5</b> or, if you are adding the Data Archiver, <b>\V5DS</b> folder
and the computer will be added to the main list box.
<ul>
<li>Try not to add the same computer twice.</li>
<li>Be patient and wait for the computer to appear in
the listbox of the main screen before clicking on another computer.</li>
<li>Be sure to find the folder in <b>My Network Places</b> and
<b>not</b> My Computer</li>
</ul>

<h3>Main Screen</h3>
<p>
<img src="./MainScreen.gif">
<p>

When you add a computer the program decides on the computer type based
upon the network name of the computer as shown here.

<center>
<table border>
<tr><td>Computer Name</td><td>Computer Type</td></tr>
<td>\\FS</td><td>Data Archiver</td></tr>
<td>\\W01 thru \\W99</td><td>Monitoring Computer (connected to DCM)</td></tr>
<td>Anything Else</td><td>Office Workstation</td></tr>
</table>
</center>
<p>The only other rule is that if the folder you click on is <b>V5DS</b> the program assumes this is a
Data Archiver.
<p>
The program uses 3 character (or fewer) names to identify the computers. These are just names
and do not have to match the actual names.
<p>
If the actual network name of the computer is longer than 3
characters the program will try to truncate it to three characters.
Sometimes this works, but if all the computers names begin with the same
three characters then it, of course, will not work and you will have to
enter a three character name.

<h3>Connections</h3>
In order for the programs to work correctly the computers need to talk
to each other. The Monitoring Computer needs to know the path to any
Office Workstations that want realtime updates and also the path to the
Data Archiver, if there is one.
<p>
The Monitoring Computers should <b>not</b> know about each other.
<p>
The Office Workstations need to know the path to each of the Monitoring
Computers, as does the Data Archiver.
<p>
If all of the Computers are online then you can connect them all by
highlighting all of them, pressing the <b>Standard Connections</b>
button, and then the <b>Save Changes</b> button.
<p>

<h3>Highlighting Computers</h3>

The list of computers is a standard windows listbox. Hold down the
<b>Ctrl</b> key while selecting with the mouse to select more than one.
Select one and drag the mouse down to select a range.

<h3>Saving Changes</h3>

When you press the <b>Save Changes</b> button <font color="red">changes are only made to the highlighted computers</font> in the list.
If the computer is not highlighted no changes are made to files on that computer.
<p>
A computer is not added to the list of saved computers until you actually save the settings to that computer so,
for instance, if you add 10 computers to the list the first time the program is run and then you save the
configuration of just one of the 10, the next time you run the program only the one computer will initially be
in the list. Of course you can load the others again by pressing the <b>Add Computers</b> button. Once a computer
is saved, it will remained saved unless you remove it.

<h3>Changing Individual Computers</h3>

If you highlight just one computer in the listbox the program will let you make changes to the configuration. You can change
the following.
<p>
<img src="./SelectOne.gif">

<ol>
<li>You can change the type of computer by checking the appropriate radio button.</li>
<li>You can change the list of Connected Computers. Click on an Available Computer to connect it. Click on a Connected
Computer to unconnect it and move it to the Available list.</li>

<li>You can change the name of the computer. This does not change the actual network
name of the computer, just the name used by the Visi-Trak ® programs on
other computers on the network. This name is not normally visible.
<br>For example, if you have two computers, WS1 and WS10, this would
allow you to refer to WS10 as WSA or W10, etc.</li>
</ol>
