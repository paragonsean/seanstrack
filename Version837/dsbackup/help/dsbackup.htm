<center><h2>Overview</h2></center>
The purpose of this program is to copy the real-time shot data from
one or more True-Trak 2020™ monitoring computers
to the local hard drive of the Data Archiver. Periodically the
program will zip the data into files.

A local copy of the True-Trak 2020™ software is installed on the Data Archiver computer as well,
allowing you to restore zipped data locally without affecting the computers on the network.

<p>
A new feature allows you to specify a file to receive the parameter data from each shot received by
the program. As all of the data is in one file and as the machine and part can be identified in the record
it is easy to set up a program like Excel to analize the data.

<h4>Exe File Location</h4>
<p>
You must run the Data Archiver Backup program (DSBACKUP.EXE) from the <b>\V5ds\Exes</b> folder of the Data Archiver.
