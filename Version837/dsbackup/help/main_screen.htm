The main screen of the program is shown here.

<p>The Status line at the bottom shows the most recent shot notification. The listbox shows the number of shots
received from each machine that is being monitored. These are the number that have not been saved. When the shots
are zipped up the count for that machine is reset to zero.</p>
<p>Normally you set the shots to be zipped either after a certain number (100 in the picture here) have been received
from a machine or else at a certain time of the day. Up to three times can be specified.</p>

<p>You can also press the <b>Zip Now</b> button at any time to zip all of the current data.</p>

<p>There are two choices under the <b>Edit</b> menu that allow you to make changes to the way
the program saves.</p>
