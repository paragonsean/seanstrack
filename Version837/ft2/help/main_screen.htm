<h3>Board</h3>
This column shows the number of the board. This is the same number that is shown in the
<b>FasTrak Board Setup</b> program. There is a radio button next to the number which, if you have more than one
FasTrak2 boards, allows you to select which board the diagnostic programs will talk to.

<h3>Address and Port</h3>
These columns show the current TCP address and port number used by the boards. These are set in
the <b>FasTrak Board Setup</b> program.

<h3>Connected</h3>
This column shows <b>Connecting</b> when the program tries to contact the board. Normally this will change almost
immediately to <b>Connected</b> when the first response is received. If no response is received <b>Not Connected</b>
is displayed. If <b>Not Connected</b> is displayed, the program will check every minute or so to see if the board
is present and will display <b>Connecting</b> followed by either <b>Connected</b> or <b>Not Connected</b>.
If a board is not set up to be monitored then <b>Not Monitored</b> will be displayed and the program will not attempt
to contact the board.

<h3>Machine and Part</h3>
This is the machine that the FasTrak2&#153; board is monitoring and the current part.

<h3>Monitor Status</h3>
The monitor status is blank when the program first connects to the board. It will show <span class=greenspan><b>&nbsp;Cycle Start&nbsp;</b></span>
until the shot data has been received and then <b>Ready</b> when the board is ready to receive another shot.
<p>
<b>New Setup</b> is displayed whenever the program has downloaded a new part setup to the board. This remains
displayed until the next cycle start is received.
