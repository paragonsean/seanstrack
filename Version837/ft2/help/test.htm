<center><h2>Ethernet Flash File Update</h2></center>
<p>
The program for updating the flash files is <b>c:\ftii\terminal.exe</b>. When you run this program you are presented with a terminal screen much like the one in the FasTrak Board Monitor program. The main area of the screen displays the communications with the FasTrak2™ board while at the bottom is a listbox where you can enter commands to be sent to the board.

If this is the first time you have used the program you will probably have to set the ethernet address of the FasTrak2™ board. Pull down the Edit menu and choose Address. The following dialog will appear. Just set the Tcp/Ip Address to the same one as you have in the FasTrak Board Setup. The Port is always 20000.

Now you are ready to upload the new flash files to the FasTrak2™ board. Make sure the die cast machine is not going to make a shot while the download is in progress. Pull down the File menu and choose Upload File. You will be presented with the following dialog. There are three files that need to be uploaded. Choose each one in turn (the buttons on the right), press the Begin button, and wait for the upload to end.

The upload is complete when you see the Upload Complete message followed by #relocation offset: 00000000.

When you have uploaded all the files you will need to <a href="./reset.htm">reset</a> the FasTrak2&#153; board for the changes to take effect.
