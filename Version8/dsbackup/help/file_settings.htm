<p><img src="./file_settings.jpg"></p>

This screen allows you to set the names of the files that are created by the Data Archiver. There are two sections.
<p>
<hr>
<p>
The top portion of this screen is for the <b>Network Shot Parameter File</b>.
The Data Archiver can combine the parameters from each shot on all the machines into a single file.
The purpose of this function is to make it easy for customers to
analyze the shot parameter data using a program like Excel.
<p>

<a name="filename"><a>
<a href="./filename.htm"><h4>File Name:</h4></a>
This is the path to the file that will be created for the shot parameter records. If you
empty this or set it to <b>UNKNOWN</b> then no file will be created.

<a name="record"><a>
<a href="./record.htm"><h4>Record Format:</h4></a>
This is the format of the record that is created when the program receives a shot from one of the
machines being monitored. You can specify what goes into this record and where it goes.
<p>
<hr>
<p>
The bottom portion of the screen allows you to name the <b>zip files</b> created by the Data Archiver Backup program. There are
two types of files.
<p>
Normally you would use one setting, one pair of names,
for all the machines and specify enough information in the file names to
differentiate the files. To do this, make sure the <b>Use a different setting for each machine</b> checkbox is NOT checked.
<p>
If that checkbox is checked then the listbox of machine names is made active and you can specify an entirely different
filename for each machine.
<p>
Note that when you uncheck the <b>Use a different setting for each machine</b> checkbox the default filename is presented
to be edited. This filename will be used for any new machines that are added later until you change the names for
that machine.
<p>
<a name="pafile"><a>
<a href="./pafile.htm"><h4>Part Results File:</h4></a>
This is the file that is created when the program reaches one of the criteria (number of shots received
or time of day) for zipping the shots. All of the saved shots and parameters are saved in this file.

<a name="mafile"><a>
<a href="./mafile.htm"><h4>Machine Results File:</h4></a>
This is the file that is created at the same time as the Part Results file but only if there has been
a change in the downtime status since the data was saved last.
<hr>
<center><h3>Mirror Drive Settings</h3></center>
<p>
If you want to automatically copy the backup zip files to a second drive you can specify a mirror drive.
In order to do this you must edit the <b>c:\v5ds\exes\dsbackup.ini</b> file and insert the 
following three lines at the beginning of the file.
<pre>
[Config]
HaveMirror=Y
MirrorRoot=E:
</pre>
The MirrorRoot is the root directory of the second drive. This does not have to be the actual root.
If you are currently saving the zip files in the <b>c:\v5backup directory</b> and the MirrorRoot is
<pre>
MirrorRoot=E:
</pre> 
then the mirror files will be saved in the <b>E:\v5backup</b> directory.
<p>
If the MirrorRoot is 
<pre>
MirrorRoot=E:\vtw
</pre>
then the mirror files will be saved in the <b>E:\vtw\v5backup</b> directory.
<p>
You can also specify a network directory as the save location
<pre>
MirrorRoot=\\vtw-backup-computer
</pre>
This will save the mirror files in the <b>v5backup</b> directory of the computer named <b>vtw-backup-computer</b>. 
<p>
Note that in order to save to a network directory that directory, <b>v5backup</b> in this case, must already exist and be shared with full access.
