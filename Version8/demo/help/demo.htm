<h3>Current Monitor Part</h3>

The <b>Current Monitor Part</b> is the part currently selected to be
monitored. You choose this in the <b>Monitor Setup</b> program.

<h3>Source Folder</h3>
The program simulates monitoring by copying shots, one by one, from a source
folder which you can choose.
<p>
To choose a new source folder
press the <b>Brouse</b> button and brouse to
a folder that contains shots, which look like <b>003012.pro</b>. Select one of the shots,
it doesn't matter which one you select as they will all be used, and then press the <b>Open</b>
button to select this folder as the current source. The folder path will be shown in red when you first
select it. When you press the <b>Start</b> button the program will begin using the new source folder and
will change the color of the path to black.

Following is a picture of the Brouse dialog. I have expanded the folder tree so show where a normal
results folder is located (in this case for machine <b>3</b> and part <b>7200901</b>

<h3>Cycle Time</h3>
This is used to tell how often to make a shot if the <b>Manual Mode</b> checkbox is not checked.
<h3>Manual Mode</h3>
If you check this a small cycle start (CS) button will appear in the upper right hand section of the
screen. Pressing this button will make a shot.
<h3>Continuous</h3>
If this is checked then when the last shot file has been read the program will start again at the start of the list.
If this is not checked then the program will stop making shots after reading all of the profiles.
<h3>Start</h3>
Pressing this button tells the program to begin getting shots from
the displayed source folder. If the path name of the source folder is shown in red then it will be changed
to black once you have pressed this button.
<p>
In any case, the program makes a list of all the profiles in the selected source folder, sorts the list, and
then begins getting shots from the folder beginning with the first entry in the sorted list of profiles.
